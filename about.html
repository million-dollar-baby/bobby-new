This is what I do, with every new work. I live my life in a balanced manner and with rewards of pampering myself after finishing a job. Life for me is like air, which becomes the breath and to keep up with my breath, I try to work out on not so regular basis, but make sure I find at least three to four days in a week.
                                I love watching films, you can call me a complete movie buff. I love world cinema. (Talking about good cinema), loves to take up new challenges in life. I believe in making good friends, and yeah I do play cricket with my friends, watch a lot of theatre and find time to read some good books.</i>”
